    <h1>Binary Search</h1>
    <p>Binary search is a search algorithm to find values in a sorted array. The binary search process begins by selecting the middle element of the array and comparing it to value being searched. If the searched value matches the selected middle value, you've found it. If the searched value is lower then the middle value, split the array and repeat the process for the lower half. If the searched value is higher, split the array and repeat the process for the upper half.</p>
